# Project Description

This project is a voxel engine created using the **Three.js** library. The main idea is to render procedurally generated worlds with camera movement in Fly Controls style and realistic global illumination effects using **SAO** (Screen-space Ambient Occlusion) and **FXAA** (Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing). The placement of objects, such as light sources and clouds, is dynamically configured, and graphics and performance settings are loaded from an external JSON file.

To launch the project, rename the `settings_example.json` file to `settings.json`, adjust settings if needed, and run the project in Visual Studio.
